#Merge sort first divides the array into equal halves and then combines them in a sorted manner.

#divide and conquer algorithm splits a list in half, and keeps splitting the list by 2 until it only has singular elements.
#Adjacent elements become sorted pairs, then sorted pairs are merged and sorted with other pairs as well. This process continues until we get a sorted list with all the elements of the unsorted input list.

#We recursively split the list in half until we have lists with size one. We then merge each half that was split, sorting them in the process.
#Sorting is done by comparing the smallest elements of each half. The first element of each list are the first to be compared. 
#If the first half begins with a smaller value, then we add that to the sorted list. We then compare the second smallest value of the first half with the first smallest value of the second half.

#Every time we select the smaller value at the beginning of a half, we move the index of which item needs to be compared by one.
