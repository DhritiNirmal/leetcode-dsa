A queue is a data structure which contains an ordered set of data.

Queues provide three methods for interaction:

Enqueue - adds data to the “back” or end of the queue
Dequeue - provides and removes data from the “front” or beginning of the queue
Peek - reveals data from the “front” of the queue without removing it
